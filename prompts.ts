The strokes defining her face are confident yet tender, with areas of intense darkness contrasting against luminous, barely-touched paper that creates her highlighted features. She wears a flowing, off-shoulder draped fabric in deep burgundy and charcoal tones that cascades around her collarbone, the texture suggested through sweeping, gestural strokes that imply silk or fine cotton.\nThe lighting is moody and cinematic: warm golden light from the right side kisses her cheekbone, the bridge of her nose, and the curve of her shoulder, while deep violet-tinged shadows pool in the hollows of her collarbones and along her neck. Subtle touches of sage green and aquamarine are woven into the charcoal medium—most prominently in her captivating eyes, but also as ghost-like accents in her dark, loosely rendered hair that appears to move with invisible wind.\nHer hair is suggested rather than detailed—wild, expressive strokes that create volume and movement, some strands sharply defined while others dissolve into abstract marks. A few loose tendrils frame her face, drawn with delicate precision.\nThe tall vertical composition creates a sense of elegance and timelessness, with intentional breathing room above and below her figure. The background is alive with emotional energy—explosive charcoal marks in the upper right suggesting turmoil or passion, transitioning to soft, meditative tones in the lower left. Include visible texture: paper grain showing through, smudged areas where fingers dragged across wet charcoal, and strategic erasing that creates ethereal highlights.\nThe overall atmosphere is one of haunting beauty—vulnerability wrapped in strength, softness containing fire—a portrait that captures the full spectrum of feminine emotional depth in the tradition of André de Dienes' iconic dramatic portraiture.",
